# adder-4bit
A simple 4 bit adder. The types of the ports were defined as unsigned
for the sake of simplicity. We recommend to use **std_logic_vector**'s
in real designs. The library package **ieee.std_logic_unsigned** was
not used because it is vendor specific extension from Synopsys or
Mentor Graphics. We tried to abide to the standard whenever possible.
